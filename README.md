# Clustering and Load-Balancing

This lab intends to demonstrate how to create a simple cluster with load balancing. By the end of the lab you will have a network that consists of the gateway, the master node and the compute nodes .

## Building the cluster

The cluster that will be created consists of the following nodes (i.e. servers/computers):

* gateway
* master node and
* two compute nodes

For this lab you can use the _Alpine_ **gateway** server that you have created in the previous labs. For the creation of the _master_ and _compute_ nodes, you could use the Debian Deskop and Debian Server appliances respectively (links to these appliances can be found at the Cryptography section).
